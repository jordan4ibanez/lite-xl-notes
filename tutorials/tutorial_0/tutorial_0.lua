This is a module. Very fancy I know.

A plugin can just be a lua file. Like this one!

Why am I calling it a module and a plugin? You'll learn this in the next tutorial!

Also, you just drop this file into your lite-xl/data/plugins/ folder and it auto loads. Yay.

Oh right, and that thing at the top, that's not just a comment, but you'll learn about this in the next tutorial.

I suppose, this is the entirety of a basic plugin, this runs, so it's a plugin. It just doesn't really do anything.

But we can't just leave it off on this comment. Let's do, at least something.

print("I am a plugin. Fear me!")
