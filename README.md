# lite-xl-notes

### These are notes on creating documentation for lite-xl

## core dev recommends:
I'd say the main concepts that might be useful for a new plugin dev are:
commands and their predicates
keymaps
commandview:enter
Doc/DocView methods
an explanation on how you can override everything
 
maybe also something about rootview/rootnod

## pathlist:
the full pathlist is in data/core/start.lua

## Important things
1. keymap shortcuts
2. running a thing from keymap shortcuts
3. interfacing into lite-xl from thing
4. a simple button that does a thing
5. a simple button that does a thing to make another button
6. a group of buttons
7. a drop down menu
8. editing helpers (scope, indentation, etc)
